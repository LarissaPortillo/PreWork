<h3> Currently watching and reading </h3>
  <p id="current">I've grown up watching Univision. So, that's why I enjoy spanish soap operas so much. I'm currently watching Ada Masali,  which is a Turkish soap opera. I'm currently reading "Measure for Measure" by Shakespeare, but not by choice. My brother is reading it for his English class and needs a reading partner to understand the text. </p>

      <td>Customer Research Project</td>
      <td>Group members and I hypothesized that Victoria’s Secret lack of inclusivity affected customers’ purchasing making decision. We conducted focus groups and distributed surveys through Qualtrics to investigate VS’s marketing and brand image through their price, product, and promotion. We analyzed the data captured by running t-tests, ANOVA tests, regressions etc. and looking at different correlations and descriptive statistics through IBM SPSS. In the end, we generated a report and PowerPoint that included potential business ideas based on the qualitative and quantitative results produced from our studies.

      <td>Visualization Project</td>
      <td>My team and I decided to take on the responsibility of using New York Time’s data on COVID cases in US Colleges to create a narrative on how the top 100 universities were handling COVID. We used Tableau to bring some visualizations to life, but mainly focused on developing graphs through JavaScript. I was mainly in charge of creating an interactive force directed graph where each virus shaped node represented each college with their node size being dependent on their respective cumulative COVID cases. The nodes could be dragged around and its color-coding was dependent on the radio button that was selected.
