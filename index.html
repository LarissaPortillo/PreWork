    I'm 23 years old. I was born and raised in Newark, NJ. My senior year of highschool, I took a computer science course for the first time. I loved the idea of creation as well as the creative freedom that coding could provide. As an undecided student about to enter college, I figured I would dip my toes into the computer science realm to see what it was all about. Although, I love Newark I did venture out to Boston, MA for college. I attended <a href="https://www.bc.edu/">Boston College</a>, where I  fell in love with:

    <ol>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Marketing</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, I majored in 1 and minored in 2. With that being said, I'm very excited to start my Per Scholas journey and hope to expand my current little knowledge of software engineering.
